# Build ziskethone's C++ ZisK guest ELF (cpp-guest/zisk).
#
# Usage:
#   ./crates/clients/ziskethone/guest/build-elf.sh [--clean] [--ziskethone=PATH]
#                                           [--toolchain-prefix=PATH] [--march=STR]
#                                           [--no-dma]
#
# The guest -march is pinned below (see ZISK_MARCH) so a plain rebuild
# reproduces the committed ELF. ZISK_MARCH or --march= overrides it for an A/B;
# an empty ZISK_MARCH falls back to cpp-guest/zisk/toolchain.cmake's own
# default. Changing it reconfigures from scratch, so a switch really takes
# effect instead of leaving the old value in the CMake cache.
#
# --no-dma (or ZEG_ZISK_DMA=OFF) drops -mzisk-dma, for an A/B of the compiler's
# block-mem* lowering. It is not "no DMA": the mem* thunks in cpp-guest/zisk/dma
# and the 33 explicit zeg::zisk::zisk_* call sites (gated on ZEG_ZISK, not on
# this flag) still reach the precompiles. That is exactly why the marker count
# alone cannot tell the two builds apart, and why this override exists.
#
# Output: <ziskethone>/cpp-guest/zisk/build/zisk_eth_guest.elf

# The march the committed ELF is built with. Pinned here rather than left to
# ziskethone's toolchain.cmake default for the same reason ZEG_ZISK_DMA is
# forced ON below: this repo owns the committed ELF, so a plain rebuild has to
# reproduce it. The delta from upstream's default is `_zba`, worth -2.34% steps
# and -0.41% area over three 140M-gas mainnet blocks now that
# zisk-transpiler-riscv proves sh<n>add/slli.uw natively (its `zba_native`
# feature, on by default from the zisk branch this workspace pins).
#
# `_zbkb` is carried over from upstream's string and is inert here — the guest
# emits none of its own instructions (pack/packh/packw/brev8/zip/unzip) and its
# `rev8` already comes with `_zbb`. Kept so the only difference from
# ziskethone's default is the one that pays.
#
# Set ZISK_MARCH to A/B a different string, or to the empty string to fall back
# to whatever toolchain.cmake defaults to. Either way the change reconfigures
# from scratch (see the stamp below).
