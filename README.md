# ZisK Ethereum Client

An experimental Ethereum execution client built for the [ZisK zkVM](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zisk).

This project enables **stateless block validation** to run, verifying Ethereum blocks without maintaining full blockchain state by using execution witnesses. The validation runs inside the ZisK zkVM, allowing blocks to be proven in real-time.

```

The `input-gen` and `hints-gen` binaries are thin wrappers over library
modules in `bin/host` (`host::input_gen`, `host::hints_gen`), so the same
logic can also be invoked programmatically from `host` itself.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable)
- [zisk](https://0xpolygonhermez.github.io/zisk/getting_started/installation.html)
- Ethereum RPC endpoint (Infura, Alchemy, or your own node) for input generation

### Clone

`third_party/ziskethone` is a Cargo `path` dependency, so cargo cannot load the
workspace until the submodules are present:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zisk-eth-client.git
```

Already cloned without them? Initialize them in place:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

That is the whole bootstrap. Rebuilding the ziskethone C++ guest's ELF needs a
cross-toolchain too, but that installs itself on demand — see
[`crates/clients/ziskethone/guest/README.md`](crates/clients/ziskethone/guest/README.md)
for its prerequisites and the rebuild command.

### Build the Guest Program

To build the Reth stateless validator guest program:

```bash
cd bin/guests/stateless-validator-reth
cargo-zisk build --release
```

The ELF binary will be located at:
```
target/riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf/release/zec-reth
```

### Building `guest-rome` / `zec-rome` (Rome protocol client)

**This client requires a checkout nested as `.fork/` under the
workspace that supplies its path dependencies.**
`crates/clients/rome/{guest,input}` depend on `rome-zk-layouts`,
`rome-zk-merkle`, `rome-zk-channel`, and `rome-zk-executor-api` at
`../../../../../crates/<name>`. See the
[guest README](crates/clients/rome/guest/README.md) for the required layout.

`guest-rome` and `input-rome` remain ordinary workspace members.
Excluding them also removes their `[workspace.package]` and
`[workspace.dependencies]` inheritance (`x.workspace = true`).
Exclusion was tested with `cargo-zisk build --release` for
`bin/guests/stateless-validator-rome` and with `cargo metadata`
from `crates/clients/rome/guest`. Both failed to inherit `alloy-consensus`
because `workspace.dependencies` was not defined. Keeping these crates
as members preserves the ELF build.

A standalone checkout without the parent workspace still fails
`cargo clippy --locked --workspace` for `guest-rome`/`input-rome`
with a Cargo path-not-found error. The other members build and lint
without those dependencies. Building the standalone
`bin/guests/stateless-validator-rome` and
`bin/guests/bench-rome-dahash` packages also requires
the nested layout.

Clone the fork inside the parent workspace using this layout:

```bash
cd <rome-zk-worktree-root>
git clone https://github.com/rome-protocol/zisk-eth-client.git .fork
cd .fork && git checkout rome-guest
git submodule update --init third_party/ziskethone
```

The nested `.fork/` checkout is ignored by the parent workspace and is not committed there.

### Execute the Program in ZisK

Some input files are available in the `bin/guests/stateless-validator-reth/inputs/` folder for testing.

Run the block validation:

```bash
cd bin/guests/stateless-validator-reth
ziskemu -e target/riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf/release/zec-reth \
        -i inputs/<input_file>.bin
```
You can also generate your own inputs using the `input-gen` tool.

### Generate an Input File

```bash
cargo run --release --bin input-gen -- rpc -u <RPC_URL>
```

Fetches the latest block from the RPC endpoint and writes a serialized input file (`<chain>_<block>_<txs>_<mgas>_zec_reth.bin`) under `reth-inputs/`. See [input-gen](#input-gen) for all options.

### Generate Prover Hints

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg zisk_hints" cargo build --release -p hints-gen
./target/release/hints-gen -f reth-inputs/
```

For each `foo.bin`, a `foo.hints` file is written to `reth-hints/` (per-client default; override with `-o`). See [hints-gen](#hints-gen) for details.

## Binaries

### host

Run the Ethereum stateless validator guest against `.bin` inputs.

```bash
host [EXECUTION_OPTIONS] stateless-validator -i <INPUT_FOLDER> [OPTIONS]
```

**Top-level execution flags** (apply to any guest program subcommand):

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-a, --action <ACTION>` | Action to perform: `execute`, `verify-constraints`, `prove` | `execute` |
| `-f, --force-rerun` | Re-run even if results already exist | `false` |
| `-o, --output-folder <PATH>` | Output folder for benchmark results | None |
| `-k, --proving-key <PATH>` | Path to the proving key file | Required for `verify-constraints`/`prove`. Defaults to installed one |
| `-l, --emulator` | Use emulator backend instead of assembly | `false` |
| `--unlock-mapped-memory` | Use the assembly backend with mapped memory unlocked (mutually exclusive with `--emulator`) | `false` |
| `--gpu` | Use GPU acceleration (verify-constraints / prove only) | `false` |
| `-v, --verbose` | Increase log verbosity (`-v` = debug, `-vv` = trace) | — |

**`stateless-validator` options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-i, --input-folder <PATH>` | Folder containing `.bin` inputs (required unless `--hints` is given) | — |
| `-c, --client <CLIENT>` | Execution client: `reth`, `ethrex` | `reth` |
| `--include <PATTERN>` | Only process inputs whose name contains the pattern (repeatable) | — |
| `--exclude <PATTERN>` | Skip inputs whose name contains the pattern (repeatable) | — |
| `--hints <PATH>` | Run against a pre-generated `.hints` file/folder (mutually exclusive with `--input-folder`) | — |
| `--gen-hints` | Generate `.hints` files inline before running (requires `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg zisk_hints"`) | `false` |
| `--hints-out <PATH>` | Output directory for `--gen-hints` (defaults next to inputs) | — |

```bash
# Execute (default action)
host stateless-validator -i reth-inputs/ -c reth

# Prove
host --action prove stateless-validator -i reth-inputs/ -c reth

# Filter inputs
host stateless-validator -i reth-inputs/ --include eip4844
```

### input-gen

Generates serialized `.bin` inputs from RPC or EEST fixtures (`reth` and `ethrex`). Full options, support matrix, and output-naming details: see [bin/input-gen/README.md](bin/input-gen/README.md).

### hints-gen

Runs the guest **natively** on existing `.bin` inputs to capture per-block hints for the ZisK prover. Requires `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg zisk_hints"`. Full options and examples: see [bin/hints-gen/README.md](bin/hints-gen/README.md).

## Using a Local ZisK Build

The standard `cargo-zisk` installation fetches the latest published version. If you need to test unreleased features or patches, build ZisK locally from source:

```bash
# Clone and build ZisK
git clone https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zisk
cd zisk && cargo build --release
```

Then use the local binaries instead of the installed ones:

```bash
# Build guest with local cargo-zisk
/path/to/zisk/target/release/cargo-zisk build --release

# Execute with local ziskemu
/path/to/zisk/target/release/ziskemu -e <elf> -i <input>
```
