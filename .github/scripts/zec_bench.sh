# zec_bench.sh — build the stateless-validator guest ELFs from the *current*
# working tree and emulate each one with `ziskemu -X` over a fixed set of block
# inputs, dumping the per-(client, block) REPORT into <OUTDIR>/<client>_<block>.txt.
#
# It is run twice by the cycle-tracking workflow: once on the PR tree and once
# on the base-branch tree. Building from the current tree each time means the
# diff reflects changes to the guest sources / resulting ELF (the workflow holds
# the emulator fixed across both runs).
#
# Usage: zec_bench.sh <OUTDIR>
#
# Requirements (provided by the workflow before calling this):
#   - CARGO_ZISK / ZISKEMU env vars pointing at the binaries built from the local
#     ZisK clone, and the ZisK rust toolchain installed
#   - RETH_TEST_BLOCKS / ETHREX_TEST_BLOCKS / ZISKETHONE_TEST_BLOCKS env vars
#     (space-separated block numbers)
#   - for ziskethone (Pattern B): the third_party/ziskethone submodule and the
#     C++ guest cross-toolchain (build-elf.sh cross-compiles its ELF)
